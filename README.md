# 🐍 Python 100 Days of Code - Bootcamp Journey

Yo, what's up! Welcome to my **Python 100 Days of Code** repo.  
This is where I’m putting in the grind as I work through **Dr. Angela Yu's epic Python Bootcamp** on Udemy. 💻  
It's all about learning **Python** and building cool stuff from scratch. Let’s gooo! 🚀

## 💥 About This Repo

- This repo holds **my practice** and **projects** from each day of the course.
- **100 days, 100 challenges.** From the basics to advanced Python, I’m tackling it all.
- Whether it's **games**, **web dev**, or **automation**, I’m gonna do it and **document** it here.



## 🚀 What I'm Learning

- **Python Fundamentals**: Syntax, variables, data types, loops, and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Mastering classes, objects, inheritance.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples — all that good stuff.
- **APIs & JSON**: Making Python talk to the web.
- **Web Dev with Flask**: Building web apps.
- **Data Science**: Working with files, pandas, and automating tasks like a pro.
- **And Much More...**



## 📂 Repo Structure

Each folder represents work I did on that specific day of the course:


Inside each folder, you'll find:
- Practice code 🧠
- Mini-projects 💻
- Challenges 🔥



## 🔥 Why I’m Doing This

I'm here to **level up** my Python skills, build awesome projects, and **get better every day**.  
I’m following the **100 Days of Code** challenge because I believe in **consistency** and **learning by doing**.



## 🎯 Goals

- Complete the **100-day journey** ✅
- Build cool Python projects 🧑‍💻
- Push my limits and learn **new stuff every day** 💪
